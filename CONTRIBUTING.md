# Contributing to Project
All contributions (pull-request) have to be done towards _develop_ branch. 
If a feature or bugfix is a major change please contact me to prepare feature specific handling.

## Branches
__master__: Branch that contains latest production (stable) release. No pull-requests other than stable releases will be merged into __master__.  
__develop__: Main development branch: contains latest features and fixes.

This will mean that __all contributors__ will have to submit a pull request to _develop_ , after successfull testing it will be merged in _master_

__Project Contributing flow__:
- Fork repository
- Create a branch off  _develop_ (name it __feature/mynewfeature__ or __fix/myfix__)
- Build, test your code against a real device
- Commit changes
- Push your changes to your fork on github
- Submit PR to esp_rgbww_fhemmodule repostitory( __develop__ branch).
- Work with other contributors to test your feature and get it merged to _develop_

This is the most common approach for a git-flow:
